### Deployment strategies

[Deployment strategies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/deployment-strategies.html) define how you want to deliver your software. Organizations follow different deployment strategies based on their business model. Some choose to deliver software that is fully tested, and others might want their users to provide feedback and let their users evaluate under development features (such as Beta releases).

AWS Lambda support 5 deployment strategies[^1]:
